# ICSOFT-ChatGPT

Open data for the paper "Can ChatGPT Fix My Code?".

In folder Java/JavaScript one can observe the created input/output pairs. P*-input.txt is the server as input for ChatGPT and P*-target.txt is the output of the tool. The questionless_input.txt and questionless_target.txt are the original input / output pairs of each dataset (buggy code / developer fix).
